# Mandoor

In this modern era, finding a reliable contractor or foreman for construction and renovation projects has become a major challenge. Many individuals and groups face difficulties in finding a reputable contractor, which often leads to construction quality issues, budget overruns, and delays in project completion. This condition leads to both financial and time losses for construction service users. To address these challenges, we developed an innovative application called Mandoor. The app is designed to be a bridge between the public and contractors, with the aim of improving access to reliable contractor or foreman information. Mandoor utilizes user input through surveys to collect data on preferences, budget, project type, and location. In addition, this application applies machine learning technology to analyze the collected data and provide recommendations for contractors that best match the user's needs and the closest location to the user. With Mandoor, the contractor search process is expected to be more efficient and effective. Through a data-driven and technology-driven approach, this app not only offers practical solutions, but also contributes to raising the standards of the construction industry in Indonesia.
